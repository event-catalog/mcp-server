## Why EventCatalog MCP Server?

EventCatalog is an Open Source tool that helps you document your event-driven architecture.
Using EventCatalog you can document your domains, services and messages, schemas and much more.

Using the **EventCatalog MCP Server** you can get more value from your EventCatalog by asking questions about your architecture in the tools you already use.

Example questions:

- What events do we have in our architecture?
- Tell me more about the {service} service.
- I want to create a new feature that will send emails when a user signs up, what events do we have in our architecture that are related to user signups?
- Get me the schema for the event `UserCreated` in EventCatalog.
- Here is a new version of the `UserCreated` schema, what downstream consumers will be affected by this change?

Rather then digging through your architecture to find the answers you need, you can ask the MCP server directly from your MCP Client.

# Getting Started

## Installation

First, you need to enable the [`LLMS.txt` feature](https://www.eventcatalog.dev/docs/development/developer-tools/llms.txt) in your EventCatalog instance.

1. Enable the [`LLMS.txt` feature](https://www.eventcatalog.dev/docs/development/developer-tools/llms.txt) in your EventCatalog instance, by configuring your `eventcatalog.config.js` file.
2. Deploy your EventCatalog instance with the `LLMS.txt` feature enabled.

Next, you will need to get a EventCatalog Scale license key, you can get a 14 day trial license key from [EventCatalog Cloud](https://eventcatalog.cloud).

### Installing via Smithery

To install EventCatalog for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@event-catalog/mcp-server):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @event-catalog/mcp-server --client claude
```

## Setup MCP Clients

Each MCP client has a different way of adding the MCP server.

You can find some helpful links below to get started.

- [Claude Desktop](#adding-the-mcp-server-to-claude-desktop)
- [Cursor](#adding-the-mcp-server-to-cursor)

## Adding the MCP server to Claude Desktop

To use this with Claude Desktop, add the following to your `claud_desktop_config.json` file. The full path on MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claud_desktop_config.json`, on Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claud_desktop_config.json`

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "eventcatalog": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@eventcatalog/mcp-server",
        "https://demo.eventcatalog.dev", // Replace with your EventCatalog URL
        "ABCD-1234-5678-9012-3456-7890" // Replace with your EventCatalog Scale license key
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Adding the MCP server to Cursor

Go to Cursor Settings -> MCP Servers -> Add MCP Server.

- Name: `eventcatalog`
- Command: `npx`
- Args: `-y @eventcatalog/mcp-server {URL_TO_YOUR_EVENTCATALOG_INSTANCE}`

### Configuration for your project

You can also create `.mcp.json` files in your project to configure the MCP server for your project using Cursor.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "eventcatalog": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@eventcatalog/mcp-server", "https://demo.eventcatalog.dev", "ABCD-1234-5678-9012-3456-7890"]
    }
  }
}
```

You can read more about configuration for your project in the [Cursor documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuration-locations).

## Missing an API?

We are working on adding more APIs to the MCP server. If you need something specific, please [open an issue](https://github.com/eventcatalog/mcp-server/issues) and we will add it to the server.


## Contributing

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies
3. Run `pnpm run build`

To use the build as your MCP server you can point your MCP client to the `dist` folder.

Example for Cursor:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "eventcatalog": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "tsx /PATH_TO_YOUR_REPO/src/index.ts",  "https://demo.eventcatalog.dev", "ABCD-1234-5678-9012-3456-7890"]
