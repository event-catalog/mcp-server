## Using AI to get more value from EventCatalog

[EventCatalog](https://www.eventcatalog.dev/) is an Open Source tool that helps you document your event-driven architecture.
Using EventCatalog you can document your domains, services and messages, schemas and much more.

EventCatalog will visualize your architecture for you all, provide the ability to add semantic meaning for stakeholders, host your OpenPAI and AsyncAPI specifications and integrate with any broker in the world.

Using the **EventCatalog MCP Server** you can get more value from your EventCatalog by asking questions about your architecture in the tools you already use.

- Developers can integrate the MCP server with MCP supported IDES (e.g [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf))
- Stakeholders can ask questions about your architecture in the tools they use (e.g [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude))
- If you are using tools that do not support the MCP protocol, you can still use the [`llms.txt`](https://www.eventcatalog.dev/docs/development/developer-tools/llms.txt) standard to integrate with other LLLM tools (e.g [Gemini](https://www.google.com/gemini/), [GPT-4](https://openai.com/gpt-4/))

# Getting Started

## Installation

First, you need to enable the [`LLMS.txt` feature](https://www.eventcatalog.dev/docs/development/developer-tools/llms.txt) in your EventCatalog instance.

1. Enable the [`LLMS.txt` feature](https://www.eventcatalog.dev/docs/development/developer-tools/llms.txt) in your EventCatalog instance, by configuring your `eventcatalog.config.js` file.
2. Deploy your EventCatalog instance with the `LLMS.txt` feature enabled.


## Setup MCP Clients

Each MCP client has a different way of adding the MCP server.

You can find some helpful links below to get started.

- [Claude Desktop](#adding-the-mcp-server-to-claude-desktop)
- [Cursor](#adding-the-mcp-server-to-cursor)

## Adding the MCP server to Claude Desktop

To use this with Claude Desktop, add the following to your `claud_desktop_config.json` file. The full path on MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claud_desktop_config.json`, on Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claud_desktop_config.json`

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "eventcatalog": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@eventcatalog/mcp-server",
        "https://demo.eventcatalog.dev" // Replace with your EventCatalog URL
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Adding the MCP server to Cursor

Go to Cursor Settings -> MCP Servers -> Add MCP Server.

- Name: `eventcatalog`
- Command: `npx`
- Args: `-y @eventcatalog/mcp-server {URL_TO_YOUR_EVENTCATALOG_INSTANCE}`

### Configuration for your project

You can also create `.mcp.json` files in your project to configure the MCP server for your project using Cursor.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "eventcatalog": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@eventcatalog/mcp-server", "https://demo.eventcatalog.dev"]
    }
  }
}
```

You can read more about configuration for your project in the [Cursor documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuration-locations).

## Missing an API?

We are working on adding more APIs to the MCP server. If you need something specific, please [open an issue](https://github.com/eventcatalog/mcp-server/issues) and we will add it to the server.

## TODO

Some ideas for the MCP server, feel free to add to the list!

- [ ] Add support for private hosted EventCatalog instances
    - We make fetch requests to EventCatalog instances, let the user specify custom headers or auth params we can add onto each request.
- [ ] Add prompts / tools to write to EventCatalog, if we get interest from the community
- [ ] Add support to get teams and users
- [ ] Add support to get flows from EventCatalog
